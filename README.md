# Java Assistant Project

This project provides a simulated Java instructor environment using OpenAI's GPT API. The assistant responds to programming-related questions and exercises in Java, offering guidance rather than complete solutions. The project utilizes Jupyter widgets to create an interactive interface where users can submit tasks, ask questions, and receive feedback.


## Project Description

The **Java Assistant Project** is designed for students seeking help with Java programming assignments. It offers hints and guidance on Java tasks, avoiding full solutions. The assistant evaluates and scores responses based on accuracy and helpfulness. 

### Key Features

- **Interactive Input**: Uses Jupyter widgets for task, question, and comment submission.
- **Java-Specific Feedback**: Provides feedback related exclusively to Java programming.
- **Response Evaluation**: Assigns a score to the assistantâ€™s response to assess quality and correctness.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- **Libraries**:
  - `openai`: for accessing the OpenAI API
  - `ipywidgets`: for creating interactive elements in Jupyter notebooks
